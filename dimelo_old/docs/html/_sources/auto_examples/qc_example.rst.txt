QC Report Example
===========================

This creates a qc report from the test bams

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-13

Creating QC Report
------------------------
Usually as a first step after receiving bam files, we want to do a quality check
and assess our data. This code generates a PDF report of important QC statistics
for long read methylation modification bam files

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-25

.. code-block:: default


    import dimelo as dm
    import os
    # first we specify the locations of our bam files
    in_bam = "../dimelo/test/data/winnowmap_guppy_merge_subset.bam"
    sample_name = "test"
    out_dir = "../dimelo/dimelo_test"

    # next we run the "qc_report" function
    dm.qc_report(in_bam, sample_name, out_dir)
    # now our output directory that we specified, will have a file called
    # "[sample_name]_qc_report.pdf"
    # All code within this block can be easily executed all at once.

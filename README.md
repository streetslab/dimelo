# DEPRECATION NOTICE:
This version of the package is currently unmaintained. Aside from a number of performance issues, it is becoming increasingly difficult to install across many platforms. We are actively working on a completely overhauled version. If you are interested in using our new software, please reach out to us! We would love to work with you to facilitate your DiMeLo-seq analysis.
